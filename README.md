# Belly Button Challenge
In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Data source

The D3 library was used to read in `samples.json` from this [URL](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json).


## Instructions
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
- Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. 
 ##
Bonus: 
- Adapt the Gauge Chart from [Plotly.ly](https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/) to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
